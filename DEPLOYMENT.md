# Netlify Deployment Guide

Your Next.js project has been successfully configured for Netlify deployment. Here's what has been set up:

## Configuration Changes Made

1. **next.config.ts** - Updated with static export configuration:
   - `output: 'export'` - Enables static site generation
   - `trailingSlash: true` - Ensures proper routing on Netlify
   - `images: { unoptimized: true }` - Disables Next.js image optimization for static export

2. **netlify.toml** - Created Netlify configuration file:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
   - Redirect rules for SPA routing

3. **TypeScript Fix** - Fixed the `any` type issue in `components/clients-content.tsx`

## Build Output

The production build is ready in the `out` directory with:
- Static HTML files
- Optimized JavaScript bundles
- CSS files
- Static assets (images, icons)

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deployment
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login to your account
3. Drag and drop the entire `out` folder to the deployment area

### Option 2: Git-based Deployment
1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically use the `netlify.toml` configuration
4. Build settings will be:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Login: `netlify login`
3. Deploy: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=out`

## Important Notes

- The project is configured for static export, so server-side features won't work
- Supabase integration will work as it's client-side
- Make sure to set up environment variables in Netlify for Supabase keys
- The build creates optimized static files ready for CDN deployment

## Environment Variables

If you're using Supabase, add these environment variables in Netlify:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Your site is now ready for deployment! ðŸš€
